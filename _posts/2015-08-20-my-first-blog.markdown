Hello, my name is Doug. Welcome to my first blog. Within these lines, I will explore things that I find interesting. What do I find interesting? Great question! Have a gold star.

I enjoy the following:

1. Code - As an developing software engineer, I would hope that it goes without saying that I like to code. Furthermore, I love to solve difficult challenges, especially in domains I know little about. This brings me to my next passion...

1. Learning - Nothing fires me up more than starting from a point of minimal understanding of a subject/domain/problem and rapidly iterating through the steps of gaining the necessary knowledge to understand/approach/solve it.

1. Hacks of all varieties - I like tips and tricks of all kinds, be they programming shortcuts or tips to get the most out of life. Expect the ones I find most interesting to find their way into this blog.

With introductions out of the way, I am happy to announce that I started Hack Reactor this week, which happens to be a combination of all of my favorite things being fed through a firehose. This week has been a blast and it only looks like it is going to get better.

For the sake of increased learning and knowledge retention, I will be attempting to blog regularly. At the very least, I will shoot for one post a week, but this may increase or decrease depending on my workload and/or sporadic feelings of lethargy/fervor.

Thanks in advance for reading!
