title: About me 
---

I am a full stack software engineer from Huntington Beach, CA, with a strong background in JavaScript, Node, Git, and Agile Software Development. My recent experience includes using front end technologies such as Angular, React, and D3, as well as back end technologies such as Node, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

I am passionate about working with other exceptional software engineers to solve complex problems, and produce modular, well-documented, and highly functional applications.

I enjoy coding, reddit, bacon, and cats. AMA.
